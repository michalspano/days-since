</h2>

A _light-weight_, __open-source Discord__ bot written in `Discord.js` with `TypeScript` that is used to track the number of days _since_ a **desired date** provided by the user.

### Usage

The usage is fairly simple - the user simply needs to type the following command in any channel the bot has access to:

```sh
@Days Since count <DD:MM:YY>
```
\*where `<DD:MM:YY>` is the date to track desired by the user.

### Demo

Here we display the number of days that have passed since the date provided by the user, namely: `28:01:2022`.
